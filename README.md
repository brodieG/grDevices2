# grDevices2

Test Bed for Changes and Improvements to Rstats grDevices Base Package.

This package is not a fully functional version of grDevices.  It contains the
bare minimum required to run the functions that are being tested.

There are three branches of interest on this repository:

* level-0: mimics the state of `grDevices` in r-devel >= 75340.
* level-1: applies the first "minimal changes" patch.
* level-2: applies level-1 and additional optimizations.
